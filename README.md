<h1><b>Passion Project: Labeled Jewelry</b></h1>

Labeled Jewelry is a mobile app / website that assists you with maintaining your jewelry and helping you figure out what jewelry is suitable for your skin type. Many of you may already have jewelry but often find yourself asking “how do I properly clean this? .. soap and warm water? solution cleaner? Do I take it to the jeweler?” With this app you will be able to select the mineral, crystals, or metals you have and a list of how to maintain each piece in your collection will be available. Also, for those who don’t purchase high end jewelry, I understand that the metals used can often fade or even turn our skin a different color! The Labeled Jewelry app will assist with letting you know if the specific metal you’re purchasing will cause any complications or deteriorate over time!

Potential feature: Jewelry stores can create accounts, upload their jewelry information so their customers can access maintenance per piece of jewelry and customers can schedule appointments with their jeweler through the app instead of calling in! :) 

Imagine, looking to propose to your soon to be fiance and the ring you put on her finger turns her skin green! Lord have mercy .. 



So, if you’re someone who loves jewelry or simply wants to be more responsible with your current collection, or even plan on gifting jewelry to someone and you want to be knowledgeable of what you’re gifting – this app/website is the one to visit/download! 


I’ll be using Spring Boot, Java, mySQL, and React!
